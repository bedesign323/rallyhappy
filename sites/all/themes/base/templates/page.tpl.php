				<p class="big center">We are a <strong> social <span class="fancy-bold">value</span> movement:</strong> an independent group organizing to promote a shared value - happiness.</p>
				<p class="big center">My name is <a href="#" data-scroll-nav="3">Kate Gregg</a>. I founded this movement because I believe in happiness. </p>
				
				<p>As defined by American English, value (noun) stands for: (i) one’s judgment of what is important in life; (ii) one’s principles or standards of behavior.<sup>1</sup> According to this definition, I consider happiness the ultimate value. First, I believe that happiness is "the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."<sup>2</sup> Second, I believe that happiness produces the highest standards of behavior. That’s a big deal. Fortunately, Thomas Jefferson, who penned the Declaration of Independence, agreed.<sup>3</sup> Thanks to his wise words in the United States of America we enjoy the exceptional right to pursue happiness.</p>

				<p>I believe that happiness deserves a voice. That way, we are forever reminded of its power. With the help of like-minded friends, I created The Happiness Movement. We are moving to make a positive change. Instead of protesting problems, we are promoting an approved, American solution – the pursuit of Happiness.  It’s that simple. It’s that important. Like Jefferson, I am starting with a declaration. If you agree, please sign on below. Leaders come in all shapes and sizes. Individually each is an inspiration; together, we can change the world.</p>
				
				<p class="big">Happily yours,<br /> <span class="fancy">Kate</span></p>

					<p>When in the course of human events dissention threatens a valued principle, the believers in that principle must take a stand. Eleven score and eighteen years ago, our founding fathers declared the pursuit of Happiness an unalienable right. They dared to dream, and then they revolutionized nationhood. What many dismissed as utopic, they made possible. Their vision launched The United States of America, a bona fide place of happiness.  Today, we are known for the American Dream, an ideal that has moved millions around the world.</p>
					<p>America is not perfect. At times we have faltered. Even in our brief history we have endured trials and tribulations. Many people have perished unjustly. However, in the face of conflict we always persevere. In America it is possible for a few brave souls to change the course of an entire nation. Through their triumphs we evolve. We continue to strengthen and refine our identity. Our circumstances do not define us; we do. We are a remarkable people. We are Americans.</p>
					<p>Today we rise up in support of happiness. We need not fight for the right to pursue happiness, for we are guaranteed this right. Instead we lead by example. We proudly declare that we believe in happiness. We pledge to value happiness and to live accordingly. May our actions inspire and empower others to join us. May we transcend our differences and embrace our common bond. With these efforts we honor America's legacy and protect America's future. Together we can restore happiness to its rightful place as a national priority.  </p>
	
					<p class="big center">In the spirit of happiness we stand united, proud to be American. </p>

				<h1>About Kate Gregg</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="inner">
				<p>Kate was born in Washington, DC. She graduated magna cum laude from <a href="http://duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a> with honors in political science. She earned her law degree from <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a> and is admitted to practice law in California. In Washington, Kate served as a policy advisor to two senior U.S. Congressmen. She also worked as a political consultant and fundraiser on high-profile U.S. House, Senate, and Presidential campaigns. By nature, Kate is a lover, not a fighter, so she decided to leave politics. Now, she lives in Los Angeles, where she studies and advocates the power of happiness for positive change. In that effort, she founded <a href="http://infinityprojects.la" target="_blank">Infinity Projects</a>, a company dedicated to the practical application of her principles. Kate is passionate about the arts, hospitality, and travel. In her free time, she actively supports <a href="http://www.teamrubiconusa.org/" target="_blank">Team Rubicon</a> and <a href="http://www.unicefusa.org/supporters/donors/nextgen" target="_blank">UNICEF’s Next Generation</a>. Above, Kate is captured enjoying one of her happy places: Malibu, California.</p>
